# DocTemplateConverter
This application was developed in conjunction with multiple deployments of the ETQ Reliance Quality Management System (QMS), where businesses needed a way to convert their legacy documents into updated Word/Excel template formats. Many of these businesses had thousands of documents to convert, so an automated utility was ideal for handling the conversions.

The ETQ Reliance application supports Microsoft Word and/or Excel files that have linkages to the metadata stored in Reliance; these files are called Office Integration (OI) templates. The application works by looking at a folder that contains all legacy/existing documents. The program then processes one file at a time from the “source” directory and processes the file according to the file type. Each file is then converted and/or copied to the “output” directory; all non-Word or Excel files are copied as-is to the output directory.
